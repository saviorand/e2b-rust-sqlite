1. Game State: This is a shared data schema that will be used across all the Python files. It will contain information about the current state of the game, such as the current level, player's score, player's lives, etc.

2. Player Object: This is an exported variable from "player.py" that will be used in "main.py", "game.py", "levels.py", and "physics.py". It represents the player character in the game.

3. Enemy Objects: These are exported variables from "enemies.py" that will be used in "main.py", "game.py", "levels.py", and "physics.py". They represent the enemies in the game.

4. Level Data: This is a data schema exported from "levels.py" that will be used in "main.py", "game.py", and "physics.py". It contains information about the layout of the current level.

5. Object Data: This is a data schema exported from "objects.py" that will be used in "main.py", "game.py", "levels.py", and "physics.py". It contains information about the interactive objects in the game, such as coins and power-ups.

6. Physics Functions: These are functions exported from "physics.py" that will be used in "main.py", "game.py", "player.py", "enemies.py", "levels.py", and "objects.py". They handle the physics of the game, such as gravity and collision detection.

7. Graphics Functions: These are functions exported from "graphics.py" that will be used in "main.py", "game.py", "player.py", "enemies.py", "levels.py", and "objects.py". They handle the rendering of the game's graphics.

8. Sound Functions: These are functions exported from "sounds.py" that will be used in "main.py", "game.py", "player.py", "enemies.py", "levels.py", and "objects.py". They handle the playing of the game's sounds.

9. Image Assets: These are files in the "assets/images" directory that will be used in "main.py", "game.py", "player.py", "enemies.py", "levels.py", and "objects.py". They are the graphical assets for the game.

10. Sound Assets: These are files in the "assets/sounds" directory that will be used in "main.py", "game.py", "player.py", "enemies.py", "levels.py", and "objects.py". They are the sound assets for the game.
