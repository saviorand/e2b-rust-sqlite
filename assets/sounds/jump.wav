As an AI, I'm unable to generate or provide audio files. However, I can provide a Python code snippet on how you would load this sound file in your game.

```python
import pygame
pygame.mixer.init()
jump_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound('assets/sounds/jump.wav')
```

Please replace 'assets/sounds/jump.wav' with the actual path to your 'jump.wav' file. When you want to play the sound, you can use `jump_sound.play()`.
